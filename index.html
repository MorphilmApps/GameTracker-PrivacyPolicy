        <h1>Privacy Policy for Game Tracker</h1>

        <div class="dates">
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 1st, 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 14th, 2025</p>
        </div>

        <h2>TL;DR - Privacy Summary</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Your game data never leaves your device.</strong> We don't run servers, create accounts, or sell data.</p>

            <p><strong>Free version with ads:</strong> Google AdMob (not us) collects device identifiers, usage data, and approximate location for ad delivery. This data is not linked to your personal identity. You control tracking through iOS settings.</p>

            <p><strong>After purchasing "Remove Ads":</strong> No more data collection from advertising networks. Your app becomes completely private - all game data stays on your device and your optional iCloud backup.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Morphilm Apps ("we," "our," or "us") operates the GameTracker mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use our App.</p>
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Game Tracker is designed to keep your game data private and secure on your device unless you explicitly give permission.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <p>Game Tracker stores the following information <strong>locally on your device</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Statistics</strong>: Dice rolls, scores, player names, game sessions, and related game data</li>
            <li><strong>App Settings</strong>: Your preferences for theme, notifications, and app behavior</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Content</strong>: Player profiles, game templates, and tags you create</li>
            <li><strong>Tutorial Progress</strong>: Whether you've completed the app tutorial and seen onboarding tips</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Important:</strong> This data is stored exclusively on your device and in your personal iCloud account (if you enable iCloud backup). We do not have access to this information.
        </div>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically (Only in Free Version with Ads)</h3>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> The data described below is collected by <strong>Google AdMob</strong> (not by us, Morphilm Apps) and <strong>only when ads are displayed</strong>. Once you purchase "Remove Ads," this data collection stops completely.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Google AdMob (Third-Party Advertising Service)</h4>
        <p>To support our small family business and keep the app free, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements in the free version. <strong>Google</strong> (not Morphilm Apps) may collect and process the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers (such as Advertising ID/IDFA)</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: How you interact with ads, ad impressions, clicks</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: Approximate location based on IP address (not precise GPS location)</li>
            <li><strong>App Activity</strong>: Which features you use and when</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver relevant advertisements</li>
            <li>Measure ad performance</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent fraud</li>
            <li>Improve ad services</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Google's Privacy Policy</strong>: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
        <p><strong>Google AdMob Partners</strong>: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903</a></p>

        <h3>Information We May Collect Through Feedback</h3>
        <p>When you voluntarily submit feedback through our in-app feedback form, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Information</strong>: Your email address (only if you choose to provide it)</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Content</strong>: The subject and message you submit</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: iOS version, device model, and app version (automatically included to help with technical support)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Feedback submissions are processed through <strong>Formspree</strong>, a third-party form handling service. We use this information only to respond to your inquiries and improve our app. Your email address (if provided) is used solely for responding to your feedback.</p>

        <h2>Tracking and Personalized Advertising</h2>

        <h3>App Tracking Transparency</h3>
        <p>Game Tracker requests your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites for personalized advertising. This is done through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
        <p>When you first launch the App, you will see a system prompt asking:</p>

        <blockquote>
            "Allow Game Tracker to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites?"
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google AdMob can use your Advertising ID (IDFA) to show you personalized ads based on your interests</li>
            <li>Ad performance may be better targeted to your preferences</li>
            <li>You may see more relevant advertisements</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you decline tracking:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You will still see advertisements, but they will be contextual (non-personalized)</li>
            <li>Your Advertising ID will not be used for cross-app tracking</li>
            <li>Ad frequency and content will not be customized based on your behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Changing Your Tracking Preferences</h3>
        <p>You can change your tracking preference at any time:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone/iPad</li>
            <li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Game Tracker</strong></li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>Allow Tracking</strong> on or off</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Alternatively, you can manage tracking for all apps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app</li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Privacy & Security</strong></li>
            <li>Tap <strong>Tracking</strong></li>
            <li>Toggle <strong>Allow Apps to Request to Track</strong> on or off</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Removing Ads = Complete Privacy</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <p><strong>Want complete privacy? Purchase "Remove Ads" for a one-time fee.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>You can purchase the <strong>Ad-Free</strong> upgrade within the App to completely remove all advertisements. When you purchase this upgrade:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All ads are permanently removed</strong> from your experience</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob stops collecting data</strong> (since ads are no longer displayed)</li>
            <li><strong>Zero tracking</strong> - No device identifiers, no usage data, no location data collected</li>
            <li><strong>100% private</strong> - All your game data stays exclusively on your device and your optional iCloud backup</li>
            <li>Your purchase is managed securely through Apple's App Store</li>
            <li>The upgrade is linked to your Apple ID and persists across reinstalls</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>After purchasing ad removal, the only data stored is:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your game statistics (stored locally on your device)</li>
            <li>Your app preferences (stored locally on your device)</li>
            <li>Your purchase receipt (managed securely by Apple, not accessible to us)</li>
            <li>Optional iCloud backup (encrypted and controlled by you)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has used the App and provided personal information without consent, please contact us through the contact form in the app, and we will work to address the concern.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> The game statistics and player names you enter are stored only on your device. We recommend that parents supervise their children's use of the App if they have concerns about data entry.

        </div>

        <h2>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. While we use Google AdMob for advertising, this does not constitute a "sale" under most privacy laws. However, you can control personalized advertising through your device's tracking settings as described above.</p>
